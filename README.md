This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to using innerHTML.  The bug involves trying to manipulate the innerHTML property of an element that does not exist in the DOM.  This results in no error being thrown, but the intended changes are not reflected in the webpage. The solution provides a safe and correct way to update the content, always checking for element existence.
